## Branching and versioning logic 

*in the future will be switched to a more CI-favourable approach*

The repository is *kinda* based onto a gitflow approach. There is a `main` and `develop` branch. 

- `main`  is the relase version, tagged with version number. It is the version that is installed on remote server. It can only receive merges from `developement`.
- `develop` is the *release* and *developement* version alltogheter. It is the last step before the release (a.k.a. installation on server). Can be also be independently modified.

In addition:
- `hotfix/` branches are quick fixes of main branches. Will be merged only into `main` or `develop`
- `feature/` branches are the actual developement branches, where new features are implemented.

The branching and versioning logic can be represented with the following diagram:

```
Tags               v0.2        v0.3         v0.4

main             ---o-----------o-----------o
                     \         /           /
hotfix                o---o---o           /
                               \         /
develop          ---o-----o-----o---o---o---o-->
                     \         /     \
feature1              o---o---o       \
feature2                               o---o-->
etc...
```
